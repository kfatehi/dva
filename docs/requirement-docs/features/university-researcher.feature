Scenario 3: University Researcher
A User is a university researcher that is trying to make the newest breakthrough 
in their field of study. That is attempting to find correlations in data that, 
at face value, seems completely unrelated. The User has all of their research 
data stored in a public database. The user wants to be able to log into the 
database from the visualization appliance and retrieve all that data without 
having to worry about important anything. From there the User can experiment 
with the data and different visualization to find correlations.
